Here are some pictures of my recent PC upgrade (not sure why the images are so large). Also sorry for the poor image quality, it was taken on my phone.

included is a list of most of the components and the links to their manufacturer websites, in case I need specfic manuals / warranties / general issues.

additionally there is some basic CPU bench marking done through Cinebench R23, show casing the lack of contact through the default LGA 1700 IHS from Intel. A $20 third party contact frame significantly improves contact, and in turn temperatures with marginal difference (within margin of error) to performance.
