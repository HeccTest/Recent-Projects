WIP (WORK IN PROGRESS)

Making my resume in website format. The styling, themes, and overall aesthetic are temporary and primarily there for high visibility. The formatting and animations are primarily what will remain, but some may need more work than others. Currently, the main thing to showcase are honestly the comments, as they highlight my thought process.
